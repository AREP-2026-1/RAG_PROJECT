What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is an AI framework that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieval systems.

How RAG Works:

1. Document Indexing: First, documents are processed and converted into embeddings (numerical representations) that capture their semantic meaning. These embeddings are stored in a vector database.

2. Query Processing: When a user asks a question, it is also converted into an embedding using the same model.

3. Retrieval: The system searches the vector database to find the most relevant documents or passages that are similar to the query.

4. Generation: The retrieved documents are provided as context to a large language model (like GPT), which then generates a response based on both its training and the retrieved information.

Benefits of RAG:

- Up-to-date Information: Unlike static LLMs, RAG can access current information from your document store.
- Domain-Specific Knowledge: You can provide specialized knowledge that the LLM wasn't trained on.
- Reduced Hallucinations: By grounding responses in retrieved documents, RAG reduces the likelihood of the model making up information.
- Cost-Effective: Instead of fine-tuning large models, you can augment them with your documents.
- Transparency: You can trace answers back to source documents.

Use Cases:

- Customer support chatbots with company-specific knowledge
- Research assistants that can query large document collections
- Educational tools that reference course materials
- Legal document analysis systems
- Medical information systems that reference clinical guidelines

Key Components:

1. Document Loader: Processes and loads documents from various sources
2. Text Splitter: Breaks documents into manageable chunks
3. Embedding Model: Converts text into vector representations
4. Vector Store: Stores and enables efficient similarity search of embeddings
5. Retriever: Fetches relevant documents based on queries
6. LLM: Generates responses using retrieved context
